# Upload Assistant `example-config.py` options

This document explains the configuration options found in `data/example-config.py`.

Upload Assistant loads configuration from `data/config.py`.

## How to use

- Generate a config interactively:
  - Run `python config-generator.py` from the repo root.
- Or create your config manually:
  - Copy `data/example-config.py` to `data/config.py`
  - Edit `data/config.py` with your own values

## Config file shape

The config is a Python dict named `config` with these top-level sections:

- `DEFAULT`: global behavior, metadata, screenshots, tool settings.
- `IMAGES`: static icon URLs used in some descriptions.
- `TRACKERS`: which trackers to upload to + per-tracker credentials/options.
- `TORRENT_CLIENTS`: qBittorrent/ruTorrent/etc client configuration.
- `DISCORD`: optional Discord bot integration.

Notes:
- Many numeric values are stored as strings (e.g. `"4"`, `"14000"`). Keep the same type unless you know a specific option is numeric.
- Tracker lists are usually a comma-separated string (e.g. `"MTV, BHD"`).

## How Upload Assistant uses this config (implementation context)

Upload Assistant is structured around a runtime `meta` dict.

At a high level:

1. `data/config.py` is imported and read across the codebase.
2. `src/prep.py` builds and normalizes `meta` from the input path + CLI args + `config` defaults.
3. Tracker metadata is fetched via `src/get_tracker_data.py` / `src/trackermeta.py` and individual tracker modules under `src/trackers/`.
4. Screenshots are captured/optimized via `src/takescreens.py`.
5. Descriptions are assembled via `src/get_desc.py` (plus tracker-specific formatting overrides).
6. Torrents are created via `src/torrentcreate.py` and optionally injected into your client via `src/clients.py`.

Important gotchas:

- Some options are read at module import time (notably in `src/takescreens.py`). If you edit `data/config.py` while Upload Assistant is running, you may need to restart the process for changes to take effect.
- Many `DEFAULT` values are copied into `meta` during preparation, and later code reads `meta` rather than reading `config` again.
- Several settings can be overridden by CLI flags (or by `user-args.json` overrides when enabled).

---

## `DEFAULT` section

### Update notifications
- `update_notification` (bool): Print a notice when an update is available.
- `verbose_notification` (bool): Print the changelog when an update is available.

### Metadata APIs
- `tmdb_api` (str, required): TMDb API key. Get it from https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api
- `btn_api` (str): BTN API key (used to fetch BTN details).

### Image host selection (priority list)
Order matters: `img_host_1` is primary, later hosts are fallbacks.

- `img_host_1`..`img_host_5` (str): Image host names. Valid examples include `imgbb`, `ptpimg`, `imgbox`, `pixhost`, `lensdump`, `ptscreens`, `onlyimage`, `dalexni`, `zipline`, `passtheimage`, `seedpool_cdn`.

### Image host credentials
- `imgbb_api` (str): API key for imgbb.
- `ptpimg_api` (str): API key for ptpimg.
- `lensdump_api` (str): API key for lensdump.
- `ptscreens_api` (str): API key for ptscreens.
- `onlyimage_api` (str): API key for onlyimage.
- `dalexni_api` (str): API key for dalexni.
- `passtheima_ge_api` (str): API key for passtheimage.
- `zipline_url` (str): Base URL for a Zipline instance.
- `zipline_api_key` (str): Zipline API key.
- `seedpool_cdn_api` (str): Seedpool CDN API key.

### Description extras
- `add_logo` (bool): Add a TMDb logo image at the top of the description.
- `logo_size` (str): Logo size (example default: `"300"`).
- `logo_language` (str): ISO 639-1 language code for logo selection (fallback to English).
- `episode_overview` (bool): Add episode overview text to description.

Implementation notes:
- These are primarily consumed by the description builders (for many trackers via `src/get_desc.py`, and for some trackers via tracker-specific modules in `src/trackers/`).
- `logo_language` influences which TMDb logo is requested; if not available, English is used.

### Screenshots
- `screens` (str): Number of screenshots to capture.
- `cutoff_screens` (str): If at least this many screenshots already exist (e.g. pulled from a description), skip capturing/uploading more.
- `thumbnail_size` (str): Thumbnail width for hosts that support `[img=WIDTH]` (default `"350"`).
- `screens_per_row` (str): Screenshots per row in description (only for some trackers).
- `frame_overlay` (bool): Overlay frame number/type and “Tonemapped” (if applicable) on screenshots.
- `overlay_text_size` (str): Overlay text size (scales with resolution).

Implementation notes:
- Screenshot capture/reuse logic is in `src/takescreens.py`. In particular, `cutoff_screens` is used to decide whether existing images in `meta['image_list']` are “enough” to skip taking new screenshots.
- `thumbnail_size` and `screens_per_row` affect how screenshot BBCode is rendered in descriptions (see `src/get_desc.py`).
- `frame_overlay` triggers extra probing work to collect frame information (slower), and can affect which tonemapping pipeline is used.

### HDR tonemapping
- `tone_map` (bool): Tonemap HDR/DV+HDR screenshots.
- `use_libplacebo` (bool): Use libplacebo-based tonemapping when available.
- `ffmpeg_is_good` (bool): Skip compatibility check (assume your ffmpeg supports libplacebo).
- `ffmpeg_warmup` (bool): Skip “warming up” libplacebo.
- `ffmpeg_compression` (str): ffmpeg screenshot compression level (`0`–`9`).
- `algorithm` (str): Tonemap algorithm (e.g. `mobius`).
- `desat` (str): Tonemap desaturation value.
- `tonemapped_header` (str): BBCode header inserted above screenshots when tonemapping occurred.

Implementation notes:
- Tonemapping decisions happen in `src/takescreens.py` based on `meta['hdr']` and `tone_map`.
- `algorithm`/`desat` are used for the non-libplacebo tonemap filter path.
- `tonemapped_header` is inserted by `src/get_desc.py` (and some tracker-specific description writers also respect it).

### Performance / multiprocessing
- `process_limit` (str): Max number of screenshot optimization processes.
- `threads` (str): Thread limit per process during image optimization.
- `ffmpeg_limit` (bool): Limit CPU usage when running ffmpeg.

Implementation notes:
- These are most visible during screenshot capture/optimization (`src/takescreens.py`). Lower them on shared/limited systems.

### Packs (season packs / multi-disc)
- `multiScreens` (str): Screenshots per disc/episode when uploading packs to supported sites.
- `pack_thumb_size` (str): Thumbnail width for pack screenshots.
- `charLimit` (str): UNIT3D season-pack description character limit cutoff.
- `fileLimit` (str): Files to include before grouping additional files into spoiler blocks.
- `processLimit` (str): Absolute limit on processed files in packs.

Implementation notes:
- Pack description assembly and character limits are enforced in `src/get_desc.py`.
- `charLimit` exists because some UNIT3D sites have strict description length limits.

### Description formatting hooks
These can be overridden per-tracker by adding the same key inside that tracker’s config block.

- `custom_description_header` (str): BBCode header added at top of description section.
- `screenshot_header` (str): BBCode header added above screenshots.
- `disc_menu_header` (str): BBCode header added above disc menu screenshots (discs only).
- `custom_signature` (str): BBCode signature appended at bottom of description.

### Torrent client integration
- `default_torrent_client` (str): Name of the client config to use (matches a key under `TORRENT_CLIENTS`, e.g. `"qbittorrent"`).
- `skip_auto_torrent` (bool): Skip automated torrent searching in your qBitTorrent client.

Implementation notes:
- Client injection/search behavior is centralized in `src/clients.py`.
- `skip_auto_torrent` affects whether Upload Assistant tries to find matching torrents in your client for reuse/dupe checking.

### UX / safety toggles
- `sfx_on_prompt` (bool): Play a bell sound effect when asking for confirmation.
- `tracker_pass_checks` (str): Minimum number of trackers that must pass checks to continue upload.
- `use_largest_playlist` (bool): Always use the largest Blu-ray playlist without prompting.
- `keep_images` (bool): If false, do not pull images from tracker descriptions.
- `only_id` (bool): Only grab IDs from trackers (skip description parsing).

Implementation notes:
- `tracker_pass_checks` is used to determine how many trackers must pass early validation before continuing (see `upload.py`).
- `only_id` and `keep_images` influence how much another tracker description is scraped/merged. The optons are independent.

### Sonarr / Radarr integration
- `use_sonarr` (bool): Enable Sonarr searching.
- `sonarr_url` (str): Sonarr base URL.
- `sonarr_api_key` (str): Sonarr API key.
- `sonarr_url_1` / `sonarr_api_key_1` (str): Optional second Sonarr instance.

- `use_radarr` (bool): Enable Radarr searching.
- `radarr_url` (str): Radarr base URL.
- `radarr_api_key` (str): Radarr API key.
- `radarr_url_1` / `radarr_api_key_1` (str): Optional second Radarr instance.

### Torrent creation
- `mkbrr` (bool): Use mkbrr for torrent creation.
- `mkbrr_threads` (str): Worker thread count for hashing ("0" = auto).

Implementation notes:
- `mkbrr`/`mkbrr_threads` are copied into `meta` during prep (`src/prep.py`) and applied during torrent creation (`src/torrentcreate.py`).
- If mkbrr fails, Upload Assistant falls back to the internal `torf` torrent builder.

### User overrides
- `user_overrides` (bool): Use argument overrides from `data/templates/user-args.json`.

Implementation notes:
- When enabled, overrides are loaded and applied in `src/apply_overrides.py`.
- Overrides are matched primarily by TMDb ID (and optionally by “other IDs” like IMDb/TVDb), then translated into the same internal `meta` flags used by CLI args.
- Read the notes at the top of the example overrides.

### Metadata enrichment / matching
- `ping_unit3d` (bool): Try to infer region/distributor IDs from existing torrents and Unit3D sites.
- `get_bluray_info` (bool): Fetch disc metadata from bluray.com (requires IMDb ID).
- `add_bluray_link` (bool): Add bluray.com link to description (requires `get_bluray_info`).
- `use_bluray_images` (bool): Add bluray.com cover/back/slip images to description (requires `get_bluray_info`).
- `bluray_image_size` (str): Width for bluray.com cover images.
- `bluray_score` (float): Minimum score to consider bluray.com release a match.
- `bluray_single_score` (float): Relaxed score threshold if only one bluray.com release exists.

Implementation notes:
- `ping_unit3d` is used for BDMV discs in `src/prep.py` and calls `ping_unit3d` in `src/get_tracker_data.py` to try and fill in missing region/distributor details.
- bluray.com integration is orchestrated from `src/prep.py` and implemented in `src/bluray_com.py`; `bluray_score` thresholds decide whether an auto-match is accepted.

### Logging / output
- `keep_meta` (bool): Do not delete existing `meta.json` before running (NOT recommended).
- `show_upload_duration` (bool): Print how long each tracker upload took.
- `print_tracker_messages` (bool): Print tracker API messages returned during upload.
- `print_tracker_links` (bool): Print direct torrent links after upload.

### Emby linking
- `emby_dir` (str | None): Directory for Emby movie linking (enables linking when set).
- `emby_tv_dir` (str | None): Directory for Emby TV linking.

Implementation notes:
- Emby NFO/link behavior is implemented in `src/nfo_link.py`.
- These options are only used when Emby mode is enabled (via CLI flags); setting these paths alone does not automatically enable Emby mode.

### Requests / predb / cross-seeding
- `search_requests` (bool): Search for matching requests on supported trackers.
- `check_predb` (bool): Also search predb for scene releases.
- `prefer_max_16_torrent` (bool): Prefer torrents with piece size <= 16 MiB when searching existing torrents.
- `cross_seeding` (bool): Enable cross-seed suitable torrents found during dupe checking.
- `cross_seed_check_everything` (bool): Cross-seed check all configured trackers even if not selected.

Implementation notes:
- Request searching is implemented per-tracker (for example, several tracker modules check `search_requests` before running request queries).
- `check_predb` is used by the scene-name logic (`src/is_scene.py`) as a fallback when SRRDB does not find a match.
- `prefer_max_16_torrent` affects how existing torrents are chosen from your client (`src/clients.py`).

## `IMAGES` section

Static icon images used in some description layouts (notably AR DB link icons):
- `imdb_75`, `tmdb_75`, `tvdb_75`, `tvmaze_75`, `mal_75`

---

## `TRACKERS` section

### `default_trackers`
A comma-separated list of tracker acronyms to upload to by default.

Example:

```python
"default_trackers": "MTV, BHD, AITHER"
```

### Per-tracker blocks
Each tracker acronym (e.g. `"AITHER"`, `"BLU"`) contains a dict of settings.

Common keys you will see:
- `link_dir_name` (str): Custom folder name used when linking content (instead of the acronym).
- `useAPI` (bool): Enable tracker API usage for automatic ID searching/description parsing (some trackers only).
- `api_key` (str): Tracker API key (UNIT3D-style trackers commonly use this).
- `announce_url` (str): Tracker announce URL (often contains `<PASSKEY>` placeholders).
- `anon` (bool): Upload anonymously when supported.
- `modq` (bool): Send uploads to moderator queue when supported.
- `draft` / `draft_default` (bool/str): Save to drafts when supported.

Implementation notes:
- If the exmaple-config does not contain the option for a tracker, then the tracker does not support that specific config option.

Some trackers authenticate via cookies instead of an API key.
If comments in `example-config.py` mention cookies, they are typically expected as a Netscape cookie file in:

- `data/cookies/<TRACKER>.txt`

### `MANUAL`
- `filebrowser` (str): If set, use your own Filebrowser link instead of uploading a file to uguu.se for manual uploads.

---

## `TORRENT_CLIENTS` section

This section defines one or more torrent clients. The name of each client block is referenced elsewhere (for example by `DEFAULT.default_torrent_client`).
- "qbittorrent" is an example of a torrent client name.
- IMPORTANT: do not change the torrent_client attribute, for example `"torrent_client": "rtorrent",` or `"torrent_client": "qbit",`

Security note: these settings can allow the app (and the Web UI) to interact with your torrent client. Do not expose your client’s Web UI to the public internet.

### qBittorrent (`torrent_client: "qbit"`)
Typical keys:
- `qui_proxy_url` (str): Optional qui reverse proxy URL. No other qbit credentials are required if using qui.
- `enable_search` (bool): Search client for existing torrents to reuse hashes. NOTE: independant of auto_torrent_searching
- `qbit_url` / `qbit_port` (str): Web UI host/port.
- `qbit_user` / `qbit_pass` (str): Credentials.
- `super_seed_trackers` (list[str]): Trackers to enable super-seeding on.
- `use_tracker_as_tag` (bool): Tag torrents with tracker acronym.
- `qbit_tag` / `qbit_cat` (str): Tag/category for uploaded torrents.
- `qbit_cross_tag` / `qbit_cross_cat` (str): Tag/category for cross-seed torrents.
- `content_layout` (str): Layout hint (example default `"Original"`).
- `linking` (str): `"symlink"`, `"hardlink"`, or empty to disable.
- `allow_fallback` (bool): Fallback to original path injection if linking fails.
- `linked_folder` (list[str]): Destination folder(s) for linked content. This is the top level directory that will contain the linked content.
- `local_path` / `remote_path` (list[str]): Local/remote path mapping (docker/seedbox), case-sensitive. Local path is how UA sees the content, remote path is how the client sees the content.
- `torrent_storage_dir` (str, optional): Only needed if API searching doesn’t work. Falls back to search the client storage directory for existing torrents.

### ruTorrent / rTorrent
- `rtorrent_url` (str): ruTorrent HTTPRPC endpoint URL (often includes credentials).
- `torrent_storage_dir` (str): Session folder path.
- `rtorrent_label` (str): Optional label.
- `linking`, `allow_fallback`, `linked_folder`, `local_path`, `remote_path`: similar meaning as qBittorrent.

### Deluge
