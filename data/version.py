Release Notes for version v6.2.0 (2025-10-26):

# 
# ## RELEASE NOTES
#  - New site support - ImmortalSeed, Emuwarez.
#  - New modules required, update with requirements.txt.
#  - Linux specific mediainfo binaries for DVD support. Uninstall existing 'pymediainfo' before running requirements.txt.
#  - Removed oxipng support, using ffmpeg based compression instead.
#  - TVDB for all.
#  - Refactored cookie/site validation processing, to speed processing.
#  - New feature, site checking. Use as 'python3 upload.py path_to_movie_folder --queue a_queue_name -sc -ua'. Append trackers as needed. You can also append '-req' (or config option). This will find all matching content from the input directory, that can be uploaded to each tracker (and list any request). Log files for each tracker will be created in the UA tmp directory.
#  - Alternatively, you can remove '-sc' from the above example, and let UA just upload content from the input directory instead of logging. You may wish to append '-lq' with a numeric value to limit the amount of successful uploads processed.
# 
# ## New config options - see example.py
#  - Multiple client searching for existing torrent files.
#  - Specific injection client.
#  - ffmpeg based compression option.

Changelog for version v6.0.0 (2025-10-03):

# ## RELEASE NOTES
# - Immense thanks to @wastaken7 for refactoring the unit3d based tracker code. A huge QOL improvement that removed thousands of lines of code.
# - To signify the continued contributions by @wastaken7, this project is now know simply as "Upload Assistant".
# - New package added, run requirements.txt
# - This release contains lengthy refactoring of many code aspects. Many users, with thanks, have been testing the changes and giving feedback.
# - The version bump to v6.0.0 signifies the large code changes, and you should follow an update process suitable for yourself with a major version bump.

## New config options - see example.py
# - FFMPEG related options that may assist those having issues with screenshots.
# - AvistaZ based sites have new options in their site sections.
# - "use_italian_title" inside SHRI config, for using Italian titles where available
# - Some HDT related config options were updated/changed
# - "check_predb" for also checking predb for scene status
# - "get_bluray_info" updated to also include getting DVD data
# - "qui_proxy_url" inside qbittorrent client config, for supporting qui reverse proxy url

# ## WHAT'S NEW - some from last release
# - New arg -sort, used for sorting filelist, to ensure UA can run with some anime folders that have allowed smaller files.
# - New arg -rtk, which can be used to process a run, removing specific trackers from your default trackers list, and processing with the remaining trackers in your default list.
# - A significant chunk of the actual upload process has been correctly asynced. Some specific site files still need to be updated and will slow the process.
# - More UNIT3D based trackers have been updated with request searching support.
# - Added support for sending applicable edition to LST api edition endpoint.
# - NoGrp type tags are not removed by default. Use "--no-tag" if desired, and/or report trackers as needed.

Release Notes for version v5.4.0 (2025-09-02):

# 
# ## RELEASE NOTES
#  - Blutopia has a peer scraping issue that resulted in UNIT3D codebase being updated, requiring torrent files to be created site side. See https://github.com/HDInnovations/UNIT3D/pull/4910
#  - With the infohash being randomized site side, UA can no longer create valid torrent files for client injection, and instead the torrent file needs to be downloaded for client injection.
#  - All UNIT3D based sites have been updated to prevent any issues moving forward as other sites update their UNIT3D codebase.
#  - This will cause small slowdown in the upload process, as each torrent file is downloaded from corresponding sites.
#  - Announce URLS for the supported sites are no longer needed in config, check example-config.py for the removed announce urls.
# 
# ## WHAT'S NEW
#  - UA can now search for related requests for the uploaded content, allowing you to quickly and easily see which requests can be filled by your upload.
#  - Request checking via config option (see example-config) or new arg (see --help)
#  - Only ASC, BJS and ULCX supported currently
#  - Added a new arg to skip auto torrent searching

"""
Release Notes for version v5.3.0 (2025-08-08):

# 
# ## NOTES
#  - From the previous release, screenshots in description were modified. Check the options in the example-config to handle to taste, particularly https://github.com/Audionut/Upload-Assistant/blob/f45e4dd87472ab31b79569f97e3bea62e27940e0/data/example-config.py#L70
# 
# 
# ## RELEASE NOTES
#  - UA will no longer, 'just pick the top result suggested by TMDb'.
#  - Instead, title parsing has been significantly improved. Now UA will use a weight based system that relies on the title name, AKA name  and year .
#  - Old scene releases such as  will easily defeat the title parsing, however these releases will get an IMDB ID from srrdb, negating this issue. Poorly named P2P releases are exactly that.
#  - Unfortunately, not only are there many, many releases that have exactly matching names, and release years, TMDb's own sorting algorithm doesn't perfectly return the correct result, as the first result, always.
#  - This means that a prompt is required. UA will display a shortened list of results for you to select, an allows manual entry of the correct TMDb ID, such as /.
#  - Given that UA would have just selected the first result previously, which could have been incorrect, some percentage of time, the net result should be a better overall user experience, since the wrong return previously required manual intervention in any event, and may have been missed previously, leading to lack luster results.
#  - As always, feeding the correct ID's into UA always leads to a better experience. There are many options to accomplish this task automatically, and users should familiarize themselves with the options outlined in the example.config, and/or user-args.json
#  - Overall SubsPlease handling should be greatly increased......if you have TVDB login details.
# 
#  ## NOTEWORTHY UPDATES
#   - Two new trackers, BT and BJS have been added thanks to @wastaken7
#   - PSS was removed as offline
#   - The edit pathway, when correcting Information, should now correctly handle existing args thanks to @ppkhoa
#   - Some additional context has been added regarding ffmpeg screen capture issues, particularly on seedboxes, also see https://github.com/Audionut/Upload-Assistant/wiki/ffmpeg---max-workers-issues
#   - Additional trackers have been added for getting existing ids, but they are currently only available via auto torrent searching
#   - Getting data from trackers now has a cool off period. This should not be noticed under normal circumstances. PTP has a 60 second cool off period, which was chosen to minimize interference with other tools.

Even in debug mode, the console should now be sanitized of private details. There may be some edge cases, please report.

## NOTES
- There is now a config generator and updater. config-generator.py. Usage is in the readme and docker wiki. As the name implies, you can generate new configs and update existing configs.
- If you are an existing user wanting to use the config-generator, I highly recommend to update your client names to match those set in the example-config https://github.com/Audionut/Upload-Assistant/blob/5f27e01a7f179e0ea49796dcbcae206718366423/data/example-config.py#L551
- The names that match what you set as the default_torrent_client https://github.com/Audionut/Upload-Assistant/blob/5f27e01a7f179e0ea49796dcbcae206718366423/data/example-config.py#L140
- This will make your experience with the config-generator much more pleasurable.
- BHD api/rss keys for BHD id/description parsing are now located with the BHD tracker settings and not within the DEFAULT settings section. It will continue to work with a notice being printed for the meantime, but please update your configs as I will permanently retire the old settings in time.
- modq for UNIT3D sites has been fixed in the UNIT3D source thanks to @AnabolicsAnonymous let me know if a site you use has updated to the latest UNIT3D source code with modq api fix, and it can be added to that sites UA file.
- You may notice that the main landing page now contains some Test Run passing displays. This does some basic checking that won't catch every error, but it may be useful for those who update directly from master branch. I'll keep adding to this over time to better catch any errors, If this display shows error, probably don't git pull.

Instead of relying solely on guessit to catch episode titles, UA now pulls episode title information from TMDB. There is some pre-filtering to catch placeholder title information like 'Episode 2', but you should monitor your TV uploads. Setting  with an empty space will clear the episode title.

Conversely (reminder of already existing functionality), setting met with some title  will force that episode title.
